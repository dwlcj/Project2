Final Project Report
Team Bismark

All in all this project went pretty well. We decided to do the whole project in GDScript and then 
convert it all into GDNative. This approach worked pretty well, but it was a little difficult 
having to figure out the equivalents of the GDScript methods and such. It took some time 
having to convert over and we had some issues, but in the end we got it all working. Going forward
from now we will be working in GDNative from the start.

We were able to implement all of the requested features thankfully. The only thing that doesn't 
meet the requirements 100% is that the camera doesn't hide or dither objects between the character
and itself. We couldn't figure out how to do this and we decided that devoting time to this would
prevent us from finishing other features on time and thus the entire project on time.
