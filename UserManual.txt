This game is a simple third-person platformer - the goal is to collect as many
coins as possible, and reach the end of the level.

-Movement-
----------
W and S move your character forwards and backwards, while A and D strafe left
and right. Within the Godot editor, another mode can be toggled that allows
A and D to rotate your character instead of strafe.

Jumping and double jumping are accomplished with the space bar. You have a max
of two jumps from any floor: this means if you are sliding off a surface you
cannot walk up (i.e. it's too steep), you still have two jumps to recover back
to another walkable floor or the end.

Some platforms are going to be too far to reach - gliding
