Project #3

-------
-About-
-------

This game is a simple third-person platformer - the goal is to collect as many
coins as possible, and reach the end of the level.

----------
-Movement-
----------
W and S move your character forwards and backwards, while A and D strafe left
and right. Within the Godot editor, another mode can be toggled that allows
A and D to rotate your character instead of strafe.

Jumping and double jumping are accomplished with the space bar. You have a max
of two jumps from any floor: this means if you are sliding off a surface you
cannot walk up (i.e. it's too steep), you still have two jumps to recover back
to another walkable floor or the end.

Ledge hanging can be performed by pressing the shift key while in contact with
a ledge. Doing so will hold the character in place, with jumps replenished. 
Shift also enables Ledge Stop if held while in contact with a floor.

Some platforms are going to be too far to reach - gliding can be performed by 
pressing the ctrl key while in midair

----------------------
-Camera/Sound Control-
----------------------

The mouse is used to control the camera. The camera orbits around the character
in 3rd person. because the mouse is captured during this, press the esc key to 
exit the game.

The N and M keys are used to toggle sound effects, while the comma(,) and
period(.) keys toggle the background music.
