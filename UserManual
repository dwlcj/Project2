Project #3

-------
-About-
-------

This game is a simple third-person platformer - the goal is to collect as many
coins as possible, and reach the end of the level.

----------
-Movement-
----------
W and S move your character forwards and backwards, while A and D strafe left
and right. Within the Godot editor, another mode can be toggled that allows
A and D to rotate your character instead of strafe.

Jumping and double jumping are accomplished with the space bar. You have a max
of two jumps from any floor: this means if you are sliding off a surface you
cannot walk up (i.e. it's too steep), you still have two jumps to recover back
to another walkable floor or the end.

Ledge hanging can be performed by pressing the shift key while in contact with
a ledge. Doing so will hold the character in place, with jumps replenished. 
Shift also enables Ledge Stop if held while in contact with a floor.

Some platforms are going to be too far to reach - gliding can be performed by 
pressing the ctrl key while in midair

----------------------
-Camera/Sound Control-
----------------------

The mouse is used to control the camera. The camera orbits around the character
in 3rd person. because the mouse is captured during this, press the esc key to 
exit the game.

The N and M keys are used to toggle sound effects, while the comma(,) and
period(.) keys toggle the background music.

-------
-Enemy-
-------

The enemy is a teapot that patrols the center platform of the stage. If you get 
close enough it will try to bump you off of the stage. It will persue you until
either you get past it or fall off the stage. If you make it past without falling off
then the enemy will become angry and jump up and down in rage. Try and using it's 
bumping to your advantage and jump over it to make it bump you further through the
stage. 

-------
-Racer-
-------

The Racer is an AI that is almost identical to you, the player. It travels at the
same speed as you and shares the same goals; collecting coins and getting to the end
of the stage. If you aren't fast enough then it will collect all of the coins before
you are able to. If it makes it to the end of the stage before you it will attempt 
to prevent you from finishing by protecting the final platform and bumping you away.
Despite being a formidable opponent, it does have one flaw. It is afraid of the enemy
who patrols the center platform. If it gets close enough to the enemy it will run in 
fear in the opposite direction. Once it gets far enough away it will return to it's 
primary goal of finishing the race. The enemy doesn't care for the Racer and only has
eyes for you, but if you draw the enemy towards the Racer you can gain a distance
advantage over it or potentially knock it out of the race entirely by making it run
off the edge of the stage.

--------
-Extras-
--------

We added a ton of extra visual flares (literally) in this project. We got rid of most
of the lighting and added a large pit of fire beneath the stage using particle effects
for the fire. A more subtle effect is that when the enemy teapot gets angry after you
pass it, it's spout now emits steam particles to show how angry it is.
